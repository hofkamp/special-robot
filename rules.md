# X-Team 60 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will assign tasks based on who volunteers for each task first, then divide up based on how many tasks a person has, what their strengths are, and what their availability is like (if they have multiple exams, etc.).

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Assuming that all work is on github, we will use a public repo. If there is noncoding work, we will check in every other day to every day based on how much time we have before the due date.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Difficulties need to be brought up as soon as they arise so that other members of the group can help out where they can or tasks can be reassigned.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

Checking in every other day to every day based on that amount of time before the due date.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

All work must be checked over before submitting by at least two people.
